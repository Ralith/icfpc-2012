SUBTLE WORLD ISSUES

  There may be lambdas which it is possible to destroy, but not to collect.
In this case the program should be sure to destroy them!


SUBTLE BUG CAUSES

  As usual when using the words "row" and "column", be aware the coordinates
and offsets are typically listed as column first, then row, which agrees with
the (x, y) convention but disagrees with common English usage.


TODO

  - Find out why we sometimes do deadly things (see: horock1)
  - Use trampolines if nothing else can be found
  - Push rocks (as a last resort)
  - Check if dropping a rock by going under it would be bad
