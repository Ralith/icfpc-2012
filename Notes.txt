SUBTLE WORLD ISSUES

  There may be lambdas which it is possible to destroy, but not to collect.
In this case the program should be sure to destroy them!


SUBTLE BUG CAUSES

  I implemented things with y=0 at the top of the world, rather than the
bottom as the spec has it.  Be aware!  (And feel free to refactor it away
if you have time.)

  As usual when using the words "row" and "column", be aware the coordinates
and offsets are typically listed as column first, then row, which agrees with
the (x, y) convention but disagrees with common English usage.
